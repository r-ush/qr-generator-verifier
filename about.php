<h2 align = 'left'>About The Project</h2>
The abstract of the project is to generate a QR Code image from records of Driver, Vehicle, and purpose of his/her visit. Suppose we are running a farm where you have hundreds of vehicles and drivers assigned to each of them, and we want some sort of verification of them. Now it's a very tedious job to manage this on a daily basis. By generating a QR Code image and sending to the drivers via WhatsApp or any other medium. They will show the received QR Code image to the administrator which is to be scanned and get verified by the authority. Initially, the project displays information of vehicle, driver, and purpose of visit along with the date, from where one can select his/her choice to generate the QR code image for any particular record. The project consists of modules such as Adding a new record, Deleting any existing record, Updating an existing record, View the History of records previously stored and able to generate QR Code image from them as well.<br><br>
